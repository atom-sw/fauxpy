Features
========

FauxPy supports seven classic fault-localization techniques in four families:

1. **SBFL** (spectrum-based) techniques Tarantula, Ochiai, and DStar.
2. **MBFL** (mutation-based) techniques Metallaxis and Muse.
3. **PS** (predicate switching) fault localization.
4. **ST** (stack-trace) fault localization.

It supports fault localization
at the level of **statements** (statement-level granularity)
and at the level of **functions** (function-level granularity).

FauxPy is based on dynamic analysis,
and can use tests written in the format of
`Pytest <https://pytest.org>`_,
`Unittest <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html>`_,
and `Hypothesis <https://hypothesis.works/>`_.

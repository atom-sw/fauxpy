Citing FauxPy and References
----------------------------

The paper `FauxPy: A Fault Localization Tool for Python <https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18596>`_ presents FauxPy in detail, including
its implementation, architecture, and
instructions on how to use it.

You can cite this tool demo paper as follows:

.. code-block:: bibtex

   @misc{PythonFL-FauxPy-Tool,
     title={FauxPy: A Fault Localization Tool for Python},
     author={Mohammad Rezaalipour and Carlo A. Furia},
     year={2024},
     eprint={2404.18596},
     archivePrefix={arXiv},
     primaryClass={cs.SE},
     url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18596}
   }

Another paper `An Empirical Study of Fault Localization in Python Programs <https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19834>`_ describes an empirical study where we applied FauxPy to 135 bugs in 13 real-world Python programs (from the `BugsInPy <https://github.com/soarsmu/BugsInPy>`_ curated collection).

This paper has been accepted for publication in the Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) journal in March 2024.

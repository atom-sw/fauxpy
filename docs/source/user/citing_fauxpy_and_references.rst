Empirical Study
===============

Our other paper
`An Empirical Study of Fault Localization in Python Programs <https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-024-10475-3>`_
presents an empirical study where we
applied FauxPy to 135 bugs across 13 real-world Python
programs from the curated collection
`BugsInPy <https://github.com/soarsmu/BugsInPy>`_.
This paper is published in the
Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) journal.

Installation
------------

FauxPy is `on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/fauxpy/>`_,
so you can install it using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install fauxpy

To install the latest (unreleased) version, use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/atom-sw/fauxpy

We mainly tested FauxPy with Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8,
but it should also work on later Python versions.

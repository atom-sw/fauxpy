## Empirical Study

The paper [An Empirical Study of Fault Localization in Python
Programs](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-024-10475-3) presents an
empirical study where we applied FauxPy to 135 bugs across 13 real-world
Python programs from the curated collection
[BugsInPy](https://github.com/soarsmu/BugsInPy). This paper is published
in the *Empirical Software Engineering* (EMSE) journal. You can cite this
empirical work as follows:

# Installation

## Prerequisites  

Ensure you have:

- Python **3.6 or later** installed  
- `pip` (latest version recommended)  

We mainly tested FauxPy with Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8, but it should
also work on later Python versions.

## Installing FauxPy

FauxPy is [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fauxpy/). Install it via `pip`:

``` bash
pip install fauxpy
```

To install the **latest development version** from GitHub:

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/atom-sw/fauxpy
```

## What is FauxPy?

FauxPy (pronounced: *foh pie*) is an **automated fault localization tool** for Python programs.  
It helps developers **locate the root cause of software bugs** using advanced **dynamic analysis techniques**.  

FauxPy is **open-source** and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/atom-sw/fauxpy).  
This documentation provides installation steps, usage instructions, and API details.

## Features  

FauxPy supports **seven classic fault localization techniques** in four families:

1.  **SBFL** (spectrum-based) techniques Tarantula, Ochiai, and DStar.
2.  **MBFL** (mutation-based) techniques Metallaxis and Muse.
3.  **PS** (predicate switching) fault localization.
4.  **ST** (stack-trace) fault localization.

It supports fault localization at the level of **statements**
(statement-level granularity) and at the level of **functions**
(function-level granularity).

FauxPy is based on **dynamic analysis**, and works seamlessly with tests written in:

- [Pytest](https://pytest.org)  
- [Unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)  
- [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.works/)
